## How to contribute

Right now, I don't have very strict contribution rules.
Trunk is a basic hobby operating system, not a production ready real world operating system.
However, there is some rules to follow

# 1.

Any new file, function, or section requires you to go to 'dev/COMMENTS.cpp' and copy the comment format.

# 2.

When making a pull request, create a new branch with the name of your feature, ex: "Driver: Keyboard"

# 3.

Make sure when writing code, use modern C++ 23 style.

# 4.

Make sure that all of your .cpp or .h files follow our namespace structure, for tklib it's just tklib:: for all of them, however for trunk. it's trunk::subsystem, ex: trunk::gdt

The only exception is Drivers, which are 3 layers. trunk::drivers::NAME, ex: trunk::drivers::serial

# 5.

Make sure to test your contribution throughly, test every feature, add debug messages, make sure it works 100%.

# 6.

Contributing mean's your code is passed under Apache 2.0 license.

# 7.

You also need to add your information to CREDITS.

# 8.

Naming convention

PascalCase - functions, structs, enums, classes

snake_case - Variables

CAPCASE - type aliases
